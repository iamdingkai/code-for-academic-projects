# code-for-academic-projects
This repository contains Matlab and Python codes used for my academic projects.

We use this code to compute the optimal time series of agriculture subsidies in OECD countries. 
Under the optimal subsidies, we compute the counterfactual decline in agriculture employment in each country, as well as social savings.
